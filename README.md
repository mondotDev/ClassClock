# ⏳ ClassCountdown

[View on GitHub](https://github.com/mondotDev/ClassCountdown)

**ClassCountdown** is a clean, customizable school schedule timer built with students and teachers in mind.

It displays the current time, shows which class period is active, and counts down to the end of the period — all with an intuitive design that works in both light and dark mode.

> ⚡ "Because the number one question in class is still: *'What period is it?'*"

## 🧠 Philosophy

ClassCountdown was inspired by real classroom needs —
to reduce distractions, support student independence, and streamline the school day.

It should be fast, battery-light, and work even if you're racing to class on 3%.
